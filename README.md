SCKTalkPhi
==========

This is the control software the Stepper Motor based Spin Coater making use of the excellent Phidgets library (http://www.phidgets.com/).

It's a Netbeans based project with two main classes containing the motor control code for either running on a Desktop computer (SCKTalkPhiDesktop.java), or running on a Raspbery Pi (SCKTalkPhiRaspberryPi.java) with an Small Touch Screen.  This approach was taken to make it easy for first time programmers to easily modify the code to fit there needs, without having to work with many source code files.
